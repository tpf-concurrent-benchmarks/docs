# AES 128

## Specifications

### Implementation

The AES-128 algorithm was implemented according to the [standard](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.197-upd1.pdf)

### Data

The data will be generated by a custom [random text generator](https://github.com/tpf-concurrent-benchmarks/various/tree/main/text_generator).

We generate a 4GB file, encrypt it and then decrypt it, 4 times.

## Benchmarks

Benchmarks will be run using 4 threads/processes.

- Measurements
  - Completion Time
  - CPU usage
  - Memory usage
