# Neural Networks

## Specifications

### Implementation

The idea of this project is to predict the median house value for California districts, given a number of features from these districts. For this purpose, a neural network will be implemented in both Python and Julia. In particular, the following neural network libraries will be used:

- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- [Flux](https://fluxml.ai/)
- [ScikitLearn](https://juliapackages.com/p/scikitlearn)

### Data

The California Housing Prices dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices/data).

## Benchmarks

Benchmarks will be run using 4 threads/processes.

- Measurements
  - Completion Time
  - CPU usage
  - Memory usage
  - GPU usage
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
